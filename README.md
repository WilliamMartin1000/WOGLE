# WOGLE
WOGLE is the **W**illiam **O**pen**GL** **E**ngine. It is a free and
open-source game engine that has been created using OpenGL as the main underlying graphics framework.

### Current features are:
- 2D Particle class that has 3 degrees of freedom (forward/back, up/down, and yaw)
- BSPT class and a Wall class that model terrain collisions and reflections
- Utility classes for textures, shader programs, VAOs, and key tracking.

### Intended features currently under development are:
- Model loading (using ASSIMP)
- .obj parser for model loading without ASSIMP
- Skeletal animation
- Hitbox class
- Lighting
